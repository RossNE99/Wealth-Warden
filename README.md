## Description
Wealth-Warden is a client-side single-page application designed to assist users in monitoring and regulating their spending patterns. Serving as a financial companion, it navigates users through the intricate world of budgeting. The application begins by prompting users to input their monthly income upon initiation. It organizes expenditures into user-defined 'Pots,' facilitating the recording of every expense. Additionally, it provides an overview of spent amounts and remaining balances. For those with specific savings objectives, the app enables the setting of savings targets, motivating users to allocate a portion of their income towards savings each month. Moreover, it generates graphs and monthly PDF reports to identify trends and illustrate spending habits.
